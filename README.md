# CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

1. CAT_DOG_classification_CNN:
    
    This project uses convolutional neural network to predict whether an image is of a dog or of a cat.
    
 
2. CIFAR10_classifier_CNN:

    Convolutional Neural Networks are used to classify images from the famous CIFAR10 Dataset. Detailed data description is provided in the corresponding notebook.
    
    
3.  MNIST_classification_CNN:

    Predictions are made on the famous MNIST Dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks. This resulted in an improvement in prediction accuracy over an artificial neural network.
